# Lab 2: Configuration Performance Learning
## Dataset details
This lab covers the datasets for nine widely studied configurable systems, each featuring a distinct configuration space, covering different option types (e.g., integers,
boolean, and enumerates) and dimensions. Specifically, these systems are
carefully chosen to span a variety of application domains, performance objectives, and programming
languages, as shown below:
